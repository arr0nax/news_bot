#### A website for fictional news (and other sites), May, 2017

#### By **Clayton Collins**

## Description

This site gets the days news, parses it in to single words, and then uses those words to construct psuedo-fake headlines that it places on real news sites.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository
* Begin MAMP or similar service in the root directory
* Make sure you have a database called `news` in mySQL
* Navigate to localhost:8888 in your web browser
* use the admin name and password `news` to initialize the site
* enjoy the nonsense


## Known Bugs

Some sites don't send all their resources which makes them appear wonky on my site. Not totally sure how to fix it. Also, sometimes the text is much longer than the original, also unsure why.

## Support and contact details

Let me know if you run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns.  Contact me or make a contribution to the code via pull request.

## Technologies Used

Drupal, PHP, CSS, newsapi.org, datamuse.org
